## Book Manager
A full stack application that let's users search for books and add it to their inventory.
Also, allows users to request books from other users and trade books with each other and also the ability to return them later on.

## Motivation
This project was build as part of the freecodecamp curriculum. Moreover this was made so that I would get a better grasp on how full stack applications are build end-to-end.
